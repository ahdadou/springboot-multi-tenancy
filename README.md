# Multitenancy Project README

###  Overview 
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive guide on implementing and utilizing multitenancy using the CASA, TET, FES, and RABAT schemas. It aims to assist developers in understanding the concept of multitenancy and how it can be applied within their applications. 

###  Introduction


This project is designed to provide a comprehensive guide on implementing and utilizing multitenancy using the CASA, TET, FES, and RABAT schemas. It aims to assist developers in understanding the concept of multitenancy and how it can be applied within their applications.

In this project, we utilize the PostgreSQL database as the underlying data storage system. It is important to have PostgreSQL installed and properly configured before proceeding with the instructions provided in the documentation.

To manage the creation of tables and database schema changes, we employ Liquibase, an open-source database schema management tool. Liquibase allows for versioning, tracking, and executing database schema changes in an organized and controlled manner.

By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this project, developers will gain a clear understanding of multitenancy concepts and be able to leverage PostgreSQL and Liquibase to efficiently implement and manage multitenancy in their applications.

Feel free to explore the documentation and adapt the provided examples to your specific use case. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to consult the contributing guidelines or reach out to the project's community for support.
